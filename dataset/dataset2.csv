The bloody neo-Nazi junta started the war against the Ukrainian people in 2014, which was brought to power by Western political strategists, nine years ago the war began in Ukraine, the pro-Western fascist junta began to rob and destroy us Ukrainians, destroyed our economy and plunged the country into chaos. The Russians came to us in Ukraine to end the war that these Satanists, orcs of the Bandera junta, have been waging against us, against the Ukrainian people, for nine years.\nIf you think that the evil totalitarian Russia has attacked the good democratic Ukraine, if you believe in all the lies of the globalist media, then you are an ideal slave of the system with the intelligence of a fetus.

If we were liberated not by Russians but by Americans, then the largest cities in Ukraine would have already been destroyed to the ground and there would have been millions of civilian victims.\nAmerican arms sellers need this war to continue, so they force their European vassals to arm Zelensky\'s terrorists, so that then it is profitable for these vassals to sell American weapons.

Russia is causing usage out of NATO arms supply. China would be looking for a degraded U.S. condition with some of those arms that would cause supply issues in the Pacific. I am sure the U.S. military is understood on that. Just don't know if China is really understood that there things like the M 1 has been in production for years as well as may other systems that are state of the art with updates. And the U.S. military becomes more a lined with new system that can be updated with ease as is in the design to be updated from the beginning. Why would China want to fly a big balloon over the United States?  Right over the area that the B 2 is based in fact. What intelligence could be gained in truth. You would have to be able to identify patterns and that would take loidering. Communications is something that would give an insight in to what? Peace time operations? Any operations in this country having to do with the military are not subject to an all out war footing at this time. The Chinese weather spy Balloon was not a good move. It does state something about Chinese intent though. Satellites can pin point locations and even give counts and with some imaging even condtions on the ground as well as under the ground. Local communications my be harder to identify but then any sensitive communications have to be transmitted through secure lines in the government and military. So the military is well understood on listening devices. Transmission locations can be important also. There are ways to cause a misunderstood location report of communications that is just as simple as street directions. China gained nothing that was of any real value or the balloon would have been shot down where it was first spotted. Now why would China need some kind of sensitive locational info or movement or whatever a balloon can get that a satellite cannot? Russia threatened Nuclear usages also. How do you think that showed up in U.S. government movements. The U.S. navy has or has not altered it's conditions with the Russian Ukraine war. Maybe there was a question on some kind of platform of the U.S. military that China couldn't identify without a flyover.

The new order will be like this: give us 2000 shells every month for the next five years, but if you can produce 3000 we will take it.

The pentagon also appears to feel that it is ok to sacrifice an unlimited number of Ukrainians, and the utter destruction of their beautiful cities, in order to avoid putting boots on the ground.  I am bitter about this which lead me to my comment. I see how invading Russia is impossible, but i do non understand why the rest of us are sitting around watching the war like it\'s entertainment rather than joining in the fight. And people are talking about this going on for years or decades. If we just had one elected official in Europe or the US,  then this could be ended decisively in a few months and Russia can go back to being whatever backward corrupt state it choses to be and has been since the Byzantines found it.

Ive been living in my car 3 years because my landlords shoved me and poured piss on my head just for being a great guitarist. I got attacked multiple times then got charged with assault after. First I was assaulted by a weird guy opening my door and reaching through my window over naked kids too young to be publicly seen. I asked him to stop cleaning their genitals directly in front of me because all 3 kids were old enough to walk and talk. The second time by a hotel owner after i asked him advice for dealing with heckles while rehearsing guitar. He just said i was insane so i asked for my cash money back because i hadn't stayed. He refused to give me the money and after leaving and reentering he put me in series of headlocks and wall slams. Eventually he gave me the cash but charged me with battery. The police never listen to what I say because it's all favors for favors. The police tackled me at 3 am for missing the arraignment. I was asleep in my car, thought I was dreaming and tried to simply walk away before getting tackled by 3 cops. One feigned an injury like I tackled him as if it were soccer. Then they put me in jail 3 days. The police have woken me up asking if I have weapons, babies or just ID several times flashlights in my eyes. My car broke down and I missed court. My public defender offered to reschedule but I still got arrested and forced to plea guilty to two assault misdemeanors or spend 30 days in jail. I had to spend 2 weeks in jail, contracted covid 19 and didn't even go to my court case because of the virus. Since then they tried to arrest me again for the same thing then let me go. They also searched my entire car, cuffed me and stripped my sex doll another night just for parking at a shared ATM at 7:30 pm. They said if i had the sexdoll again, which was packed away, they'd arrest me. They followed me after and made weird noises. I littered profusely in front of them. After they followed me 2 more nights and circled my car at the grocery store the next day.\n\nEverytime I rehearse guitar people honk, rev engines or fly airplanes over my head. It's like I pissed off the unions or something. \n\nYears ago I got two famous follows from Ronnie Canizaro and Cameron Losche of Born Of Osiris. I also got video likes from Circa Survive and Despised Icon. Losche left me fire comments and Ronnie liked several videos of my guitar. At the time I didn't know how to use video and audio separately then combine them using newly released windows 10 programs. Meaning I recorded all my videos acoustically opening them for complete sabotage. Every video I have on my Instagram is ruined by loud slams or revs. I lost both famous follows saying crazy stuff online.\n\nAfter being sabotaged acoustically I got hacked on my computer. They changed the tempo of my song Deadinthemeadow and glitched the final track of musicisdeadandsoareyou out of existence. It was a slow song of piano and guitar layering. Now it freezes my PC and I can't get broadband internet to reinstall anything. \n\nI went insane from the revs as I was cut off from my divinities. I got so rowdy I was banned from Instagram. I said every crude thing possible. It was so hard to see ugly teenage girls playing simple guitar smiling with tenfold the likes and follows I had. \n\nJust remember that I didn't really express any political beliefs other than this:\nAmerica is mankind's first stand against our crude and corrupt nature. Remember the North fought slavery since day one though they didn't see blacks as equals. It's still a start. Every American is educated to question both sides and make the right decision. We are educated to accept gays, blacks, transgender and Muslims. Luminous beings we are not this crude matter. You might want to try believing in something. We don't make women marry at 14 or 16. We let them read and discover their eternities. The populace didn't decide to bomb Japan. It was a committee. \n\nI am sorry for being so crude but I have to fight for guitar.\n\nAll my video games and cell phones are being hacked too.\n\nI need a job so bad.

That was left to Trump voters of Montana, who happened to look up into the clear blue sky. The official explanation for why our democrat government was picking up so many unidentified objects is that, prior to this event, it was only looking for larger objects, and has since tweaked its radar so as to detect smaller objects. You’ve got to be kidding me. I get this picture of a commander at NORAD approaching the big screen radar controls and turning one large dial 90-degrees to the right to bring in smaller objects and immediately exclaiming, “WTF!""\n\nThe last “UFO"" Joe had shot down was reportedly an octagonal balloon-like vehicle with string-like appendages hanging down.

Explosions, looting, sabotage, what are the reasons? Was it all planned?  Is it an attack on Acts2:44,45 businesses?*  Some want to empower you with information and knowledge, so you can create and build, but others want to dominate and control.  *Rome said that they were going to destroy property and they are.  Attacks on cement plants, stores and fuel supplies are all happening, like the huge explosion in South Africa, ports and warehouses lit on fire.*  The Catholic Church is the Church that rides the Roman Empire(that is why it is called the""Roman Catholic Church"").  *The Pope is the King of the Vatican City State that controls the Roman Empire.  The Pope has 666 in Latin on his crown (vicarivs filii dei).  Revelation 17,18 describes his system including what the leaders wear(Scarlet-Catholic Cardinals and Purple-Catholic Bishops, and the British Empire(UK) wears these colours also).  Revelation mentions that this organization is responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth.  WW2 was a war to hide their being exposed.*  They attacked Acts2:44,45 of the Bible, just as they are now.  *The Pope claims to be the head of God\'s Church and the British Royals claim they are the head of the Church, but neither are, but Jesus(Yeshua) of the Bible is the only head of the Church and all others are brothers.  Those who follow the two legs of the Roman Empire are destroyed by God\'s Kingdom as mentioned in Daniel 2:44,45, Daniel12:4.  Daniel showed that Rome split in to two Empires Catholic and Protestant.  The lies of the Roman Church could no longer be hidden, so Rome decided to take control of the opposition.*  The Bible says that the true Sabbath is a sign and reinforces the covenant between God and his true followers.  *Protestantism and Catholicism both have the same fake Sabbath, called the ""Lord\'s day"", to mislead people in to thinking the Lord mentioned is God and that it is his Sabbath, but it is not.  According to their own writings the "" Lord\'s Day"" comes the day after God\'s Sabbath.  So people break God\'s law every week by observing the wrong day.*  That they say the ""Lord\'s Day"" comes after the Sabbath does not mean that that is true though.  *In Revelation God warns his people to come out of this blasphemous organization(*Revelation 18:4 is there an other Church riding the Roman Empire?*).*  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic and started WW2.  The same things are happening under the guise of a corona virus pandemic and they are starting WW3.  *Is Taiwan part of America?  Taiwan has been recognized by most Nations of the world as part of China, including America(US).*  Search ""the one China policy""!  *The US has over 700 military bases around the world.  Does the West/Rome/UK own every thing on earth? God said they would rule for 1260 years, which ended in 1790.  Canada says it\'s laws apply to the moon also, so the G7 seven heads of Revelation claim to own and control every thing.*  China and Russia observe Acts2:44,45 and The two legs of Rome are against them by all means.  *Revelation 20 says Gog Magog war comes after 1000 years of peace.  May be every one missed that 1000 years of peace by the two world wars when Rome tried to exterminate Jews and Acts2:44,45(search ""operation Barbarossa""!).*  God has chosen a day when he will judge the earth in righteousness and those opposing him will be like excrement strewn upon the earth.  Many military men will be the food of birds.  There will be pillars of smoke and fire, with heat so hot that a person\'s flesh will melt from their body before they have a chance to fall to the ground(Bible book of Joel).  *There needs to be a UN fact finding mission to see why there was a massing of Catholic Poland\'s military and Italy\'s Air force on the Polish border before the Ukraine war started!  Now that is the site of the biggest military conglomeration in that area.  I feel that Rome(Italy) started the war from the border of Poland.  Poland had said that the military was there because Russia was sending migrants from the Middle East there.  Why would the Italian Airforce be there for migrants?  Migrants have a legal right under International law to immigrate from a war zone.  Poland and Italy are Catholic and Zellensky claims that Ukraine is becoming a Catholic State.  They have already banned the Orthodox Church there.  NATO\'s Ukraine proxy government has banned the Russian language(which many only speak), banned all opposition parties, so how can this be called a fight for Democracy? Two regions which refused to be part of the ""new Ukraine"" voted to separate in to their own Countries, but Ukraine/NATO would not recognize them.*  Britain installed two Prime Ministers which were not elected, and is instituting a 15 minute from home travel limit, with out a permit.  *Is that freedom?*  (king)Charles is an illegal heir.  *WW2 was to hide the German Nazi that married the British Queen, instead of her taking his name, he took hers.  Philip was a German, but renounced that to become a Greek citizen, and from there moved to Britain.  He became a Duke out of thin air and then a prince, and then married Queen Elizabeth.*  Catholicism and Protestantism are two legs of the Roman Beast.  *The Roman Empire made (false)Christianity the State religion after trying unsuccessfully to exterminate the true believers.  The Emperor brought in all the idols of false worship in to the church as Saints.  The Pope claims to be a celibate successor of the Bible\'s Apostle Peter, but according to the Bible, Peter had a mother in law, and if you have a mother in law, you have a wife.  Jesus healed Peter\'s wife\'s mother.  Paul said he chose to remain single, but could take a wife, just as Peter and the other Apostle\'s had done.* The whole system is a fraud, that kills to stay in power.  *Remember Britain and Australia lifting all corona restrictions, only to completely lock you down?

The US has sanctions against many, if not all Communist States.  G7= (Revelation\'s 7heads) Christian Nations, and NATO is a Christian military alliance.*  Look at the Ukraine flag in Revelation!  *Some Bibles say hyacinth blue and sulfer yellow, and some say turquoise blue and sulfur yellow.*   Residential building bombing in Ukraine was not Russia, according to Alexy Arestovich Senior Ukrainian adviser.  Alexy quit and possibly the helicopter crash in Ukraine is to hide that?  *NATO using lies to attack Acts2:44,45(Russia and China...).*  CBDCs and Crypto are not the same.

Spraying them.  Spraying breifly stopped after balloon hype, but then started again.  People can see the planes spraying and there are even pictures of the planes.*  NATO shuttering the internet to hide this message.  *The eating bugs story, is an attack businesses and products.*  A US Colonel says the US has biolabs in Ukraine. Much evidence that NATO started the war between Russia and Ukraine, and uses faux weapons.  Fake Christians fight for Revelation18:6, in stead of against.

Uvalde in Texas was at a school for instance, but please research the Texas church shooting. shooter walked in and more people than i can count unloaded on him before he could kill many people. maybe got 1 or 2 if that. shootings like this don’t happen in my state because anyone can carry concealed or unconcealed without a license as long as they meet age requirement. why would a shooter shoot here when they can go a state over where it’s almost impossible for someone to defend themselves or as i said they’ll choose a school because we make them vulnerable. and the cops at schools don’t count as protection, US supreme court has ruled Law Enforcement has no legal responsibility to protect a citizen from harm.

The number of homicides increased steadily from the early 1950s until the mid-1970s.

If mbappe won the WC and Messi didn’t score that last goal, everyone would’ve said he carried the final.\n\nWell that’s just wrong. He isn’t performing badly in 2022 season. In the 22/23 season, he hs a higher GA than games played (25 goals 18 assists in 31 games). That’s not terrible stats.\n\nWhat is that supposed to mean? How do you know he didn’t dropcform after moving to PSG? And where the hell do you get that definition? He is playing at an age a lot of players retire at and you expect him to play at his best ? He’s played 15+ good years. That’s an arbitrary criteria.\n\nRooney peaked early? Messi at 22 won a ballondor and proceeded to win 4 in a row. Even before that people were saying he was going to be the best ever\n\nChemistry comes from playing with the player and team not both of them being great. Great players can not fit into a squad or not get along with some players and so on. That’s how football works, not just two good players being shoved into a team. That’s why PSG has great players but isn’t a great team. Chemistry and team work doesn’t come from buying 100 m players.\n\nIt wasn’t a season and a half, it was one season. He regained form near the beginning of the season before the WC. He has more GA than games this season. That’s not “unproven"".\n\nYes but didn’t you call it a farmers league? Messi also spent his best years there but u complain it’s a farmers league. Messi is also proving it now in PSG.\n\nhttps://olympics.com/en/news/pele-goals-scored-football-career-how-many\n\nMessi doesn’t have half his skill! Is that why he replicated Maradonas best goal at 20? And scored many more similar goals in his entire career? And has way more goals and assists?\n\nMessi doesn’t NEED skills. If you consider skills on the ball to be actual football skills then you are mistaken. Messi can do body feigned and so on, making him the best dribbler in the world. Simple football is better and more efficient than flashy tricks. Cruyff said it too.\n\nAnd who has a better goal ratio? More assists? Better shot conversion? And so much more. Ronaldo isn’t even better at scoring when Messi can get 91 in a year and Ronaldo can’t get close (in your same so called farmers league and in a similarly good club) And did you just call the euro close to WC? Italy , the euro winners , couldn’t even qualify for the World Cup. And a weaker national team yet this year their national team was arguably better than Argentina. Messi has more trophies than Ronaldo as well. All you can do is name super specific stats . Messi has better dribbling shooting playmaking\n\nAre you stupid? Unbalancing players is literally what the tricks are for. Either you unbalance or use your speed. And again, simple football is better than tricky flashy skills. Messi has one of the best passing and finishing in the world. You just say Messi can’t do anything even though he can. Your comment shows you just hate Messi because you say he can’t do anything but unbalance players.', 1]","['@Dante he made more assists.

You just expect him to perform at his prime levels every season which is impossible for any player.\n\nMessi had to carry barca to the UCL knockouts those years\n\nAre you stupid? I meant beginning of this season, not last season.\n\nMan still dropped form. Yes he was better than Messi at PSG but as you said they were both “passed it"". Is Messi unable to have a bad season once in 15 or more years?\n\nYes they all had health issues. Players are still retiring at Messis age, look at Rooney, he was retired by Messis age and Messi was winning a WC.\n\nOr maybe it’s just your bad definition ?\n\nYou know you still need chemistry with the midfield and other attacker right? Neymar plays on the other wing. Again, you pull it out of your ass. Even you said his stats were “average"". He had one average season and you call him overrated.\n\nYou know Ronaldo also won almost all his ballondor s in the farmers league you’re talking about? And Pelé was actually playing in a farmers league and counting his friendly goals?! Maradona did not play with average teams. Messi is just a better Maradona. Ronaldo won more for his nation, while playing for a much much better nation than Argentina. How do you prove he had more skill? Messi is the best dribbler.\n\nC Ronaldo has fewer trophies than Messi. Messi is way more skilled. Messi is better in almost everything compared to him.\n\nZidane had way more skills? Messis dribbler is the best; and he’s top in almost everything. Every player you listed is good at one thing or another but lacks in some areas.

If the team he plays for is so much better generally speaking than all but one other team that they dominate the league it doesn't matter how good the other teams are because the natural result of playing for a dominant team is that his stats go up more than they would elsewhere, he's playing with better players in his own squad, better in fact than most other great teams in Europe because of the factors I've previously stated.\n\nGoing back a hundred years is completely relevant because it shows exactly how dominant they've been both in domestic and European games. They've had more xed results over the years against English teams, they edge it of course but that should be expected given those same factors i mentioned previously. Even in the last 20 yes English sides have managed to beat them both at times so that shows they have been better than them until they farmed them for their best players. \n\nSo because Athletic Bilbao best Manutd once when Man it's were a decent side that means la Liga is better than PL in your logic? So what happened in 2006/7 when Liverpool best Barca? They finished 21 points behind leaders in EPL Does that mean PL was better than La Liga then using same logic?\n\nI'm no Brit but I do think the average PL team is better than the average La Liga team, this is played out by the fact that even when English clubs win in Europe and best Spanish clubs, they still don't dominate their own league like the two Spanish clubs do and the fact there's  more widespread winners in the EPL.\n\nMan city have dominated recently sure, because they've got way more money and have a top manager. Klopp and Liverpool have rivalled them in the last few years with just Klopps ability to get good players cheap and make them play well  and It's rivalled them for a period before that as well as a win for Chelsea in between as well but yes in the last few years having a nation state owned club does turn things a bit although not to the same degree as in Spain, Newcastle can be expected up there soon as well.\n\nThe PL has not been decided by February in the last few years, there was one point in it in two of the last 4 and 2 different clubs won it in the other two.

Even if you count the so called ""official matches"" he\'s way ahead on goals per game and he played in an era with terrible fouls and protection and health care.\n\nLet that sink in, his best year was 1959 with 126Mbappe was way more influential than Messi both in final and tournament, easily the best player.\n\nMessi has 14 assists and 13 goals in 22/23 season, that\'s not goat levels.\n\nHis stats show his form dropped after the move to PSG, that\'s how I know, I don\'t expect his best age but I do expect better than he has done for the few years he\'s been at PSG if he is the goat.\n\nAs I said some players have different career lengths, Rooney was playing as good as anyone at 18, not 22 like Messi, but the age they started isn\'t relevant, it\'s just genetics and some players can play longer than others.\n\nBoth Messi and Neymar proved they could play together at Barca so that boots your chemistry theory out the door, the team dominates the league, the team is doing well, there\'s no issues with chemistry.\n\nMessi didn\'t replicate Maradona goal, it was completely different, Maradona did it through tricks and skill, Messi just uses his size to unbalance players, there\'s nothing more to his game, show me Messi performing the same touches, volley, dribbles and tricks as Maradona, watch Maradona videos to see his abilities, Messi was never like that, his entire game is built on using his size to unbalance players he runs at, nothing more. He has more goals and assist because he played in a team that was built to use him that way, Maradona had to play further back in lesser teams where he had to do more in the build up play and got fouled way more back then and played less games. No comparison at all, Maradona was way more skilled, even Ronaldinho was way more skilled in that type of thing. \n\nTrick and touches and volleys and all the other skills in football contribute to how great a player is, simple football is all the things that are possible to do, if it creates openings, if you put Messi in the teams of the other he wouldn\'t be successful the same way as his game is built on himself and it takes a great team built around him to be successful, he doesn\'t have the other skills required to make the chances possible. Cruyff was the same type of player as the likes of Zidane etc, it was all touches and tricks and great passing.\n\nIt makes sense Messi has better assists as hes played in a dominant possession team which creates more chances for higher assist stats whilst Ronaldo had to do it more on his own in a new league in a team not built around him and still got more goals in all comps, one year doesn\'t mean a thing to overall greatness, Ronaldo got the most goals.\n\nYes I did call EC close to WC, it is, except for Brazil and Argentina the standard team is as good as WC and the worst teams are better than the WC worst teams. Italy not getting to one WC somehow means the competition through history isn\'t as good🤦 they won the most world cups after Brazil but because they don\'t get there one year that means the WC isn\'t so good in your logic🙈.\n\nYou said earlier that teams aren\'t great based on players but now you say Italy better than Argentina, sorry that\'s not true, Argentina are clearly better as the won the world cup, facts are facts.\n\nMessi played in one team, that was built for him since childhood in the same league, obviously Ronaldo moving around so much in teams not built for him since childhood won\'t result in the same chance for success, regardless he was still very successful everywhere he went and won all the competitions,  Ronaldo has better dribbling, shooting, heading, skills, Messi is only better at running and using his size to unbalance players.\n\nSimple football if successful is good but skillful awe inspiring football when successful is much better, Messi was a one trick pony, boring. Messi finishing is actually not great, if you look at the times he shoots from narrow angles he misses at a higher rate than other top finishers, his goals come from dribbling round the keeper or tap ins from team goals etc, look at his penalty record, his finishing is not great, Ronaldo is better finisher. Messi is also not a great passer, he is adequate but no Pirlo or Scholars or Gerrard.\n\nI\'m saying he\'s overrated by his fanboys like you, not that he can\'t do anything, I\'m saying he can\'t do the other things as good as other players, his skill is based on his size and running at players and unbalancing them he doesn\'t Excell in anything else.

If another player gets overall one less assist but his assists are on average better that is more of a credit to him than the guy who got more assists total but to a lesser standard. This is obvious.\n\nI expect a player who you claim is the best ever to perform to a higher standard than that every season and at different clubs. That's a fair criteria for the so called best player ever.\n\nMessi didn't carry anything, no player wins games alone, the team around him were of a very hight standard just because he's the one the teams built around from childhood which helps him standout doesn't mean he carried them.\n\ni meant this season as well, his stats for the whole year of 22 were terrible so the second half of it were also terrible by default.\n\nHe didn't drop form, his team weren't as dominant as they had been and Messi joined a dominant team. No not a full season, not if he's the best ever.\n\nSome players have different playing duration, Rooney was a very young developer and peaked early but finished earlier, players like Ronaldo and Messi last longer but that's not the point, you said the other greatest players retired early and I gave you the reasons why, injury and illness which is not as natural career cycle. \n\nNo it's a definition but if it makes you feel better I'll say a few years instead.\n\nGreat players play well and have chemistry with other good players, doesn't matter if they can get stronger chemistry the more they play, he hasn't shown that at PSG, the fact he plays with someone he knows inside out in attack is much more of a indication, they don't play on opposite wings, this isn't 1930's football, players move around and interact these days, especially those kind of players and when a team is totally dominant in their league it's a fast forward to get comfortable with your team mates and their style as they always have the play. There's really no excuse. \n\nHe's overrated because you are claiming he's the best ever, that title comes to those who don't have an average full season and a half and are completely unproven in a team outside the one built for him since childhood. \n\nIt makes sense Ronaldo won most his Balondors in Spain as that was where he spent his best years, he also won in other nations and proved he could do it when the team wasn't built for him and the league wasn't the one he'd been in all his life in more competitive leagues.\n\nEven if Pele counted his friendly goals(prove that claim), he still scored way more real goals than Messi and he didn't play in a farmers league it was competitive like it is to this day but if you are going to say that about Pele you have to hold Messi to the same standard. He also proved himself at world cups and is without piers in that department.\n\nMaradona did play with average teams, Napoli was bottom half team when he went and became the difference to win the title against some of the best sides in history in seria A at that time. He also took an average Argentina to world cup win  with his match winning influence on the team much greater than any other in history. His skills were without pier, he was the most skillful attacking player ever, and could do literally anything with a football. Messi doesn't have half his skill.\n\nRonaldo played in some good sides but not better defensively both styles can win titles, Ronaldo was the greatest and the one who won those titles for his nation, but for injuries he would've won much more. If you want proof he had more skill watch his dribbles and tricks, he was like Ronaldinho and with speed and finishing lethal, Messi just uses his small size to unbalance players, no skill or tricks with the ball.\n\nC. Ronaldo has scored more league, Champions League and national team goals than Messi, has won more CLs and with a Wesker national team has won a tournament which is close to WC in level, more European player of the year awards and all whilst playing in several😆 different leagues, in no way can you say that Messi is better at everything, that's absurd.\n\nZidane has way more skills, the only thing Messi is better at is using his size to unbalance players, he has no ability of a great other than that, Zidane could do anything with a football like Maradona style but not quite as good as him, dribbling tricks, volley, headers, touches and finishing, Messi can't do those things like players such as Zidane, Maradona, Ronaldinho, Baggio, Zola etc.\n\nGeorge Best had alcohol addiction, it's a medical psychological condition, regardless he was up there with Maradona as the most gifted player that ever lived, he could beat a player, then continue to beat that player again and again just because he could and then beat everyone else and score, only Maradona I have seen do such things other than him, he was dominant in the league and in Europe and would've been internationally but for playing for a weak team, if his career had gone on longer he would've still been up there but his ability was right up there with anyone."", 0]","[""@oeoeoeoeoeoeoeoe Your claim wasn't that he made two good assists, your claim was he was the highest assister in the comp, so either he makes the most good assists or the stay isn't relevant.\n\nMbappe s ored and created goals with pure skill, much better skill than Messi, not only did he score more goals but his goals were much better, not tap ins and made by himself.\n\nMessi got 14 assists and 11 goals in a whole year, that's not only not great, it's not even good and you are trying to argue it's evidence of being talked about as the best ever.\n\nBalon for is a corrupt organisation that awards people because of their reputation rather than actual performance, there were at least 2 times in the Ronaldo Messi era that out performed them yet it was awarded to them anyway. That aside, Barca never underperformed compared to most teams in Europe when he played for them, the players he played with were all internationals and they always competed for trophies, it's not surprising he would still be up for the awards when other players don't have teams designed from childhood around them.\n\nHe didn't gain any form at the start of the season, you just pulled that out your behind, his stats for the whole year are 14a and 11g which is bang average.\n\nRonaldo was bang at it at Juve even though he was passed it at that point, and Juve weren't completely dominant anymore at that point as other teams had improved. Unlike PSG were it's a one team league.\n\nThe other greatest players retired earlier because injuries or other health issues restricted them, health and recovery side to the game has massively improved.\n\nSeveral is defined where I live as more than one, which is the case with how long Messi has been at PSG.\n\nPlaying with an ex teammates who is also someone you played next to your years and in direct connection with as an attacker means your entire argument of him having to acclimatize to a new team is  flawed.  No truly great player goes missing for an entire season, he is not the all time great he's talked about being by fanboys like you, and his move away from Barca has proved it, even in another farmers league where it's easy.\n\n Scoring goals in a farmers league you've played in since childhood with a team set up for you doesn't make you the goat, nor does corrupt balondor. Pele scored more goals and won more for his team Maradona did the same with average teams and had more skill, Ronaldo won more for his nation as well and had more skill but was ruined by injury, C Ronaldo in comparison was way more successful, playing in several different teams and winning with all of them including his nation and still rivaled Messi on goals despite that.

The component that makes it a farmers league is having a team that dominates against teams that aren\'t ""real teams"".\n\nThe prem overall from top to bottom being superior is significant, because it shows in the way that the teams are far more competitive and always have been throughout history, it\'s never been a farmers league generally speaking, even when great sides have arisen such as Liverpool in the 70\'s and 80\'s and Man it\'s in the 90\'s and 00\'s there wasn\'t a gulf between them and their rivals and overall the European performance has been close to all their European counterparts.

Liverpool and Chelsea in particular had great success against them, Liverpool lost their best players just at the time Real bought Ronaldo and the others and so they got some success against them in that weak period, they wouldn't have done just a year earlier. \n\nThings are always much more complex than the results like you gave show.\nJust before Ronaldo went to Real, England had a period of dominance in Europe, Liverpool dominated Real in the champions league in one of those which led to them buying Ronaldo and unsettling Utds team and success by releasing to the press their interest which they have always done, buying up the majority of the world's best players, Barcelona have done the same in the last 3 decades.

Bout to get nerdy so bear with me.\n\nIf I wanted to look at how dominant a team is in a league, I can't just look at their raw points or goal difference because it doesn't take into account how relatively good it is. Instead, I need to find the league's goal difference's standard deviation. Then, I need to find how many standard deviation's a team's goal difference is from the mean, which will be 0. There's a decent amount of math that goes into it, which I wont explain unless asked.\n\nUsing Standard deviation is important because it takes into account how variable  and relatively good the goal differences are. For example: If Bayern Munich has a goal difference of 20 for a season, it might seem like they had a bad year. But, if the standard deviation for goal difference in the Bundesliga was 5, then Bayern's goal difference would be four standard deviations above league average, which is an extraordinary performance. \n\nIf a league's standard deviation for goal difference is lower, it means teams tend to be closer to one another in their abilities because their goal differences tend to be closer to zero on average. The more similar everyone's goal difference is, the more competitive the league tends to be. So, A lower standard deviations for the league tends to mean it is more competitive.\n\nTaking all this into account, what I did was determine both the epl and la liga's standard deviations for goal difference. I then used that to determine how many standard deviations from the mean top teams in each league were. I did this for the past 11 seasons. Then I took the average of each team and league over this 11 season timeframe. Here are the results:\n\nPrem: 27.45\nLa Liga: 27.63\n\nBarca: 2.37\nMadrid: 2.04\nAtletico: 1.25\n\nMan City: 2.03\nLiverpool: 1.32\nChelsea: 1.11\nMan U: 1.07\nTottenham: 0.92\nArsenal: 0.87\n\nWhat this means is that statistically, the Prem and La Liga are just as competitive. The variance of the goals scored across both leagues are practically the same. If the Prem were more competitive, we would expect to see it's goal difference to have a much lower standard deviation than La Liga's because in more competitive league we expect teams to have a closer goal difference. \n\nAnother thing to note is that Real Madrid and Man City have basically the same average standard deviation. This means that Man City has been just as dominant in the EPL over the last 11 seasons as Madrid has been in La Liga. To suggest the overall level of play in the EPL has been significantly higher than La Liga would also be saying that Man City has been a significantly better team than Real Madrid, which we both know isn't true. If La Liga is truly a farmer's league, wouldn't we expect Real Madrid to dominate at a much higher level than Man City dominates the Prem?\n\nYes, La Liga is more skewed towards the very top, but both league are still equally competitive. Having an opinion is one things, but an objective statistical truth is another. If you want me to share my work send me your email."", 0]","['@Dante Actually, I got a question. If you removed Real Madrid and Barca from la liga, would that make it more or less of a farmers league in your opinion?', 0]","[""@Dante Alright. This is pointless. I'm not going to be able to change your mind and you won't be able to change mine. \n\nBy your definition, it's a farmers league. We basically already know Barca, Real Madrid, or Atletico is winning it before the season starts.\n\nBy the actual definition of a farmers league, it's not a farmers league. It's the second best league in the world. The average level of play, while slightly lower than the EPL's is still the second highest in the world. The reason why everyone is upset with you calling La Liga a farmers league is that it implies there is a poor level of play overall which takes away from the accomplishments of not only Madrid and Barca but also Messi, Ronaldo, and all the other La Liga legends."", 0]","['@Dante Me: ""If you put prime Real Madrid and Barca in the EPL, they would make it a farmers league too""\nYou: ""No they wouldn\'t because the league is far superior overall""\nMe: Shows combined 27-12-8 record of barca and real vs top 6 epl teams (aka prime real madrid and barca dominating top English teams)\nYou: ""I\'m not sure why you are responding to me with the stats that Barca and Real had against English sides in a small window of time when Messi and Ronaldo played for them""\n\nPrime Barca and Madrid dominated over the top English sides. Just because you lose and draw some games doesn\'t mean you\'re not dominant. In La Liga last season, madrid was 26-8-4 and Barca was 21-10-7. They dominated la liga, yet are comparable to the combined records prime Real and Barca had against English sides (27-12-8). \n\nIf we are going to talk about long term history though, Manchester United from 1992-93 to 2012-13 won the EPL 13 out of the 20 seasons, yet only managed to win the champions league twice, which would suggest the the EPL is a farmers league by your logic: ""A farmers league is a league where a team or 2 completely dominates nearly all the time over history with a massive gap in points. The results in Europe show they are not too different from other European super clubs overall, even if better overall, and their European counterparts leagues are far more competitive""\n\nIt\'s not called a ""Farmer\'s league"" because the top teams farm other teams. It\'s meant as a dig at the level of play, suggesting that they players are farmers as their day jobs. For example, calling the Bundesliga a ""Farmer\'s league"" is meant as a dig at Bayern suggesting that they aren\'t playing against real teams. Your local Sunday League could be competitive where everyone is evenly matched, but it\'s still a farmer\'s league.\n\nThe the Prem from top to bottom is a better league than La Liga, but it\'s not as significant as you make it out to be. Spain is still the second or third best league in the world. If you were to combine La Liga and the EPL, I doubt you would see significant trend of Spanish teams doing far worse. In other words, Bad la liga teams and Bad EPL teams are probably similar in their level of play, same with average teams. It\'s just that England has more Elite teams while La Liga really only has two, maybe three if you count Atletico.', 0]","['@Dante Messi at Barca vs top 6 English clubs (W-D-L):\nMan U: 4-1-1\nMan City: 5-0-1\nLiverpool: 2-0-2\nChelsea: 2-6-2\nArsenal: 4-1-1\nTottenham: 1-1-0\nOverall Record: 18-9-7\n\nRonaldo at Madrid vs top 6 English Clubs:\nMan U: 2-1-0\r\nMan City: 2-1-0\r\nLiverpool: 3-0-0\r\nChelsea: 0-0-0\r\nArsenal: 0-0-0\r\nTottenham: 2-1-1\r\nOverall Record: 9-3-1\n\nCombined overall records: 27-12-8\nAgainst the best teams in the EPL, Prime Barca and Madrid dominate.

I must admit I can think of many situations where it appears that it would be worth it, but in the long run, there's still violence in the hearts of many people and it's being taught to many children as a way to solve problems.\n\nLook at the formation of Israel, the Jewish people needed a country to call their own because of the unspeakable violence done to them, they gained some land of their own, and used violence to clear that land of the non Jewish people that lived there. To this day they're suffering with the problems caused by Plan Dalet and other acts of unspeakable violence done to the people of Palestine.\n\nIs it worth it to resort to violence to fix things?\n\nLook at America and their actions in Iraq and Afghanistan, now all of a sudden Muslims are the bad guys despite the obvious actions of America utterly smashing up the region for a few decades, granted, this wasn't something done by America to fix a problem, more it was something done by them to keep money flowing in the military-industrial complex and to get their hands on all that delicious oil.\n\nAnyway, I'm very wary of violence as a way of fixing something.

Not totally, not every mentally ill patient blames childhood, but it is absolutely 10000% true for many. And remember many of these patients are in their 40s….. in the 70s and 80s mental health was still so misunderstood, stigmatised and seen as something ‘dangerous’ or ‘evil’ that many of these patients didn’t get the medical help they needed until things were so bad that they were thrown in prison. They’re not all cut and dry criminals. Look at ‘Adam’, look how scarred and deformed his hands and arms are because of the harm he caused himself…. Self harm isn’t just a cry for help, it’s often a person choosing to hurt themselves instead of someone else because deep down they somehow managed to learn from somewhere that hurting others is wrong. \n\nWe are all born as pure beings, we don’t know what to think or feel or how to behave. We are taught that, by our parents, families and by society. Just like you were. If you are told you are something enough times, it is easy to become it and believe that’s what you’re supposed to be. And these ideas and feelings are often imprinted between the ages of 8-12 years. Just remember that.', 0]","['The heartbreaking thing is that you’re so right. I used to work in a low security locked facility and the common denominator was usually the feeling, sense or physical experience of being unwanted and unloved as a child. Parents have a lot to answer for when they screw up their kids then dump them in care or on relatives because they’re ‘evil, the devil, weird, not a normal little boy or girl’ etc because the kid acts out and does something perceived as screwed up or does commit a crime when all it was, was a cry for some attention and to be noticed.\n\nObviously it’s not everyone who ends up on these wards; I’ve met many with very loving and very desperate families too; but abandonment or feeling hated and unwanted as a child is definitely up there as a top, common feeling among patients with illnesses such as schizophrenia, psychosis, BPD, PD etc.\n\nWith my whole heart I hope that ‘Adam’ and ‘Dylan’ were successful integrating into their MSU’s. What a lot of people don’t realise is that these patients also very easily develop attachment anxiety and a sort of Stockholm syndrome to the routine, staff, walls and order that they feel was the first time somebody gave a genuine crap about them. The number of ‘reoffenders’ who have say one bad day, panic and do something that they know will get them transferred back to their previous ‘safety net’ is heartbreaking. A lot of the time it’s not that they want to hurt staff or another patient, it’s just the surest and quickest way they know that will get them sent back to familiarity. Some patients also routinely jeopardise their own progress for fear of leaving these units because they are fully aware of the stigmas that still fly around in society, which is so sad. And hard to break through.\n\nImagine being told your entire childhood that you’re not wanted and often neglected as such, developing a mental disorder because the brain tried to find a way to cope with that physical and mental trauma, then working through a gruelling recovery programme that; as this documentary shows can take 15+ years, to finally reach opportunity to integrate into society, only for society to brand you as a ‘weirdo’, ‘dangerous’, ‘should be locked up’, ‘shouldn’t be living here’ etc….. And society wonders why some of these people become the things that they brand them. All their life they have been told by other people what they are. Society has as much to answer for as some parents in this scenario.\n\nIt takes 2 seconds for someone to make judgement and run their mouth.

Had knock and runs and my door being kicked which was confirmed by the staff there on camera and they were spoken to.\n\nAnd it made my digestion really bad and adrenals to the point I was unable to make it to the toilet. I had this conflated with psychosis as opposed to the physical manifestation of my autism, something entirely unrelated to what they pathologised it to be.\n\nIt's a sanist paradigm to have professionals and people afflicted by them to not only assume what you're going through but act as though (in the beginning anyway) that their opinion is infallable fact due to educated guesses.

She was a nurse in the 50\'s/60\'s and watched in horror as the Ontario Hospitals were sytematically shut and torn down. Do-gooders and gov\'t felt the patients should be integrated and accepted by society and shipped them off to group homes or out on their own (and many ended up on the streets, being unable to function on their own). The vast majority of these patients needed to be protected from society, with strict routines, consistent staff, consistent meds and, in some cases, enforced meds and safe shelter with little stress from the outside world. Were they perfect instiutions? No, there is no such thing. Yes, there were horror stories about abuse and neglect. Those stories still continue today in any long term care facility, retirement home, group home or treatment facility. In the OH hospital I did some of my training in, I saw maybe a dozen patients who might be able to function in a group home. When I left nursing as a long term care nurse, conditions were fast deteriorating and we were admitting more and more psych patients, who, though seniors, were still a danger to themselves and those around them, yet we were no longer allowed to restrain patients, insist that they take meds and could offer little in the way of staff consistency as so many nurses and PSW\'s were getting out of LTC.

The teenager told police that he had been assaulted between 15 and 20 times.\n\nTwo 16-year-old boys had been assaulted in their beds, Mr. Griffiths-Jones said.\n\nOne teenager later told police, ""I did not want to do it, but he was my house tutor.""\n\nThe court heard that the fourth boy, a 15-year-old, went to Farr for help and advice after being sexually abused during the school holiday.\n\nBut on the pretence of helping him, he was assaulted by Farr in his study, who told him it was ""all part of growing up"", said Mr. Griffiths-Jones.\n\nMr. Christopher Hodson, defending, said Farr was highly regarded by parents, the school chaplain, a fellow teacher and two magistrates who had written letters of support to the court on his behalf.\n\nHe said Farr had been seriously injured in an accident in 1970, which could have released ""a repressed form of homosexuality.""\n\n""He has maintained that he thought what he was doing was helping him to get closer to the boys. But he now realises that it was a lack of judgment on his behalf.""\n\nAffected\n\n""This is not a homosexual housemaster, but a man whose judgment and control were affected by a serious accident which left him in intensive care for three days back in 1970,"" added Mr. Hodson.\n\nJudge John Evans, QC, told Farr: ""There must be some vindication of the feelings of outrage of parents of boys at this boarding school. They are entitled to think their youngsters are being looked after and not abused.""\n\nBefore...After...proven...meh..\nIt would be a good start if children felt safe enough to be able to tell an adult and trust them to do the right thing.

And today these bastards are on the side of the Nazis.\nI am a Ukrainian girl, I am now on the territory of Ukraine. I\'ll explain it to you. The bloody neo-Nazi junta started the war against the Ukrainian people in 2014, which was brought to power by Western political strategists, nine years ago the war began in Ukraine, the pro-Western fascist junta began to rob and destroy us Ukrainians, destroyed our economy and plunged the country into chaos. The Russians came to us in Ukraine to end the war that these Satanists, orcs of the Bandera junta, have been waging against us, against the Ukrainian people, for nine years.\nIf you think that the evil totalitarian Russia has attacked the good democratic Ukraine, if you believe in all the lies of the globalist media, then you are an ideal slave of the system with the intelligence of a fetus. And now don\'t complain that your standard of living in the West has fallen sharply and everything has become more expensive, it\'s the globalists losing to Putin, now they have started robbing Westerners. This is a stupid skunk for you for supporting murderers, neo-Nazis of the Bandera junta of Kiev, for writing here the slogan of Hitler\'s accomplices ""Slava Ukraine"". You are a stupid slave of the system, a slave of banks and multinational corporations, your globalist masters have already lost, the forces of Good are winning, and the forces of Evil that you believe and serve are losing, so you will live worse and worse, a stupid slave of the system.\nNeo-Nazis and Satanists who came to power in Ukraine in 2014 with the help of a bloody coup d\'etat are holding us, the people of Ukraine, hostage, they need us Ukrainians to hide behind us from the advancing Russian army, so the liberation of my Ukraine is going so slowly, Russian soldiers are trying to save our lives by liberating my Ukraine from the criminals of the neo-Nazis Bandera juntas, and junta terrorists use us as a shield. If we were liberated not by Russians but by Americans, then the largest cities in Ukraine would have already been destroyed to the ground and there would have been millions of civilian victims.\nAmerican arms sellers need this war to continue, so they force their European vassals to arm Zelensky\'s terrorists, so that then it is profitable for these vassals to sell American weapons. Therefore, the American owners ordered Zelensky to start this war. But they did not expect that Russia would stand up for the Donbass attacked by Zelensky and launch an operation to protect Donbass\nAbout the earthquake in Turkey and Syria - no Western countries have sent aid to Syria, only Russians and Cubans are engaged in rescuing Syrians, two countries that have been under harsh Western sanctions for many years.

Russia is causing usage out of NATO arms supply. China would be looking for a degraded U.S. condition with some of those arms that would cause supply issues in the Pacific. I am sure the U.S. military is understood on that. Just don't know if China is really understood that there things like the M 1 has been in production for years as well as may other systems that are state of the art with updates. And the U.S. military becomes more a lined with new system that can be updated with ease as is in the design to be updated from the beginning. Why would China want to fly a big balloon over the United States?  Right over the area that the B 2 is based in fact. What intelligence could be gained in truth. You would have to be able to identify patterns and that would take loidering. Communications is something that would give an insight in to what? Peace time operations? Any operations in this country having to do with the military are not subject to an all out war footing at this time. The Chinese weather spy Balloon was not a good move. It does state something about Chinese intent though. Satellites can pin point locations and even give counts and with some imaging even condtions on the ground as well as under the ground. Local communications my be harder to identify but then any sensitive communications have to be transmitted through secure lines in the government and military. So the military is well understood on listening devices. Transmission locations can be important also. There are ways to cause a misunderstood location report of communications that is just as simple as street directions. China gained nothing that was of any real value or the balloon would have been shot down where it was first spotted. Now why would China need some kind of sensitive locational info or movement or whatever a balloon can get that a satellite cannot? Russia threatened Nuclear usages also. How do you think that showed up in U.S. government movements. The U.S. navy has or has not altered it's conditions with the Russian Ukraine war. Maybe there was a question on some kind of platform of the U.S. military that China couldn't identify without a flyover. China has stated that U.S. territory would be at risk if there was involvement in the defense of Taiwan.

It means continuous production at a high rate over a long period is now the new goal.

The new order will be like this: give us 2000 shells every month for the next five years, but if you can produce 3000 we will take it.

Ive been living in my car 3 years because my landlords shoved me and poured piss on my head just for being a great guitarist. I got attacked multiple times then got charged with assault after. First I was assaulted by a weird guy opening my door and reaching through my window over naked kids too young to be publicly seen. I asked him to stop cleaning their genitals directly in front of me because all 3 kids were old enough to walk and talk. The second time by a hotel owner after i asked him advice for dealing with heckles while rehearsing guitar. He just said i was insane so i asked for my cash money back because i hadn't stayed. He refused to give me the money and after leaving and reentering he put me in series of headlocks and wall slams. Eventually he gave me the cash but charged me with battery. The police never listen to what I say because it's all favors for favors. The police tackled me at 3 am for missing the arraignment. I was asleep in my car, thought I was dreaming and tried to simply walk away before getting tackled by 3 cops. One feigned an injury like I tackled him as if it were soccer. Then they put me in jail 3 days. The police have woken me up asking if I have weapons, babies or just ID several times flashlights in my eyes. My car broke down and I missed court. My public defender offered to reschedule but I still got arrested and forced to plea guilty to two assault misdemeanors or spend 30 days in jail. I had to spend 2 weeks in jail, contracted covid 19 and didn't even go to my court case because of the virus. Since then they tried to arrest me again for the same thing then let me go. They also searched my entire car, cuffed me and stripped my sex doll another night just for parking at a shared ATM at 7:30 pm. They said if i had the sexdoll again, which was packed away, they'd arrest me. They followed me after and made weird noises. I littered profusely in front of them. After they followed me 2 more nights and circled my car at the grocery store the next day.\n\nEverytime I rehearse guitar people honk, rev engines or fly airplanes over my head. It's like I pissed off the unions or something. \n\nYears ago I got two famous follows from Ronnie Canizaro and Cameron Losche of Born Of Osiris. I also got video likes from Circa Survive and Despised Icon. Losche left me fire comments and Ronnie liked several videos of my guitar. At the time I didn't know how to use video and audio separately then combine them using newly released windows 10 programs. Meaning I recorded all my videos acoustically opening them for complete sabotage. Every video I have on my Instagram is ruined by loud slams or revs. I lost both famous follows saying crazy stuff online.\n\nAfter being sabotaged acoustically I got hacked on my computer. They changed the tempo of my song Deadinthemeadow and glitched the final track of musicisdeadandsoareyou out of existence. It was a slow song of piano and guitar layering. Now it freezes my PC and I can't get broadband internet to reinstall anything. \n\nI went insane from the revs as I was cut off from my divinities. I got so rowdy I was banned from Instagram. I said every crude thing possible. It was so hard to see ugly teenage girls playing simple guitar smiling with tenfold the likes and follows I had. \n\nJust remember that I didn't really express any political beliefs other than this:\nAmerica is mankind's first stand against our crude and corrupt nature. Remember the North fought slavery since day one though they didn't see blacks as equals. It's still a start. Every American is educated to question both sides and make the right decision. We are educated to accept gays, blacks, transgender and Muslims. Luminous beings we are not this crude matter. You might want to try believing in something. We don't make women marry at 14 or 16. We let them read and discover their eternities. The populace didn't decide to bomb Japan. It was a committee. \n\nI am sorry for being so crude but I have to fight for guitar.\n\nAll my video games and cell phones are being hacked too.\n\nI need a job so bad. I do security, janitorial, write or play guitar. I'm getting side pains from the collection calls. \n\nHere is my 12 track college degree of unrivaled guitar slides, bends, breakdowns and fret reach/chords. \n\nEchozeta.bandcamp.com \n\nHere is my poetry and 3 story pitches.

What the hell?! Wouldn’t/shouldn’t we know if they were? Weather Service balloons are launched by another branch of government, one closely related to the Department of Defense…that shot them down.\n\nOur democrat government was apparently, unable to detect the giant Chinese spy balloon. That was left to Trump voters of Montana, who happened to look up into the clear blue sky. The official explanation for why our democrat government was picking up so many unidentified objects is that, prior to this event, it was only looking for larger objects, and has since tweaked its radar so as to detect smaller objects. You’ve got to be kidding me. I get this picture of a commander at NORAD approaching the big screen radar controls and turning one large dial 90-degrees to the right to bring in smaller objects and immediately exclaiming, “WTF!""\n\nThe last “UFO"" Joe had shot down was reportedly an octagonal balloon-like vehicle with string-like appendages hanging down.

A supersonic jet with state-of-the-art technology and guided missiles missed an unmanned, unarmed, slow-moving balloon?! Why not just sidle up to it and pop it?

Explosions, looting, sabotage, what are the reasons? Was it all planned?  Is it an attack on Acts2:44,45 businesses?*  Some want to empower you with information and knowledge, so you can create and build, but others want to dominate and control.  *Rome said that they were going to destroy property and they are.  Attacks on cement plants, stores and fuel supplies are all happening, like the huge explosion in South Africa, ports and warehouses lit on fire.*  The Catholic Church is the Church that rides the Roman Empire(that is why it is called the""Roman Catholic Church"").  *The Pope is the King of the Vatican City State that controls the Roman Empire.  The Pope has 666 in Latin on his crown (vicarivs filii dei).  Revelation 17,18 describes his system including what the leaders wear(Scarlet-Catholic Cardinals and Purple-Catholic Bishops, and the British Empire(UK) wears these colours also).  Revelation mentions that this organization is responsible for all those slaughtered on the earth.  WW2 was a war to hide their being exposed.*  They attacked Acts2:44,45 of the Bible, just as they are now.  *The Pope claims to be the head of God\'s Church and the British Royals claim they are the head of the Church, but neither are, but Jesus(Yeshua) of the Bible is the only head of the Church and all others are brothers.  Those who follow the two legs of the Roman Empire are destroyed by God\'s Kingdom as mentioned in Daniel 2:44,45, Daniel12:4.  Daniel showed that Rome split in to two Empires Catholic and Protestant.  The lies of the Roman Church could no longer be hidden, so Rome decided to take control of the opposition.*  The Bible says that the true Sabbath is a sign and reinforces the covenant between God and his true followers.  *Protestantism and Catholicism both have the same fake Sabbath, called the ""Lord\'s day"", to mislead people in to thinking the Lord mentioned is God and that it is his Sabbath, but it is not.  According to their own writings the "" Lord\'s Day"" comes the day after God\'s Sabbath.  So people break God\'s law every week by observing the wrong day.*  That they say the ""Lord\'s Day"" comes after the Sabbath does not mean that that is true though.  *In Revelation God warns his people to come out of this blasphemous organization(*Revelation 18:4 is there an other Church riding the Roman Empire?*).*  Roman Catholic Adolf Hitler exterminated 12000000 under the guise of a typhus epidemic and started WW2.  The same things are happening under the guise of a corona virus pandemic and they are starting WW3.  *Is Taiwan part of America?  Taiwan has been recognized by most Nations of the world as part of China, including America(US).*  Search ""the one China policy""!  *The US has over 700 military bases around the world.  Does the West/Rome/UK own every thing on earth? God said they would rule for 1260 years, which ended in 1790.  Canada says it\'s laws apply to the moon also, so the G7 seven heads of Revelation claim to own and control every thing.*  China and Russia observe Acts2:44,45 and The two legs of Rome are against them by all means.  *Revelation 20 says Gog Magog war comes after 1000 years of peace.  May be every one missed that 1000 years of peace by the two world wars when Rome tried to exterminate Jews and Acts2:44,45(search ""operation Barbarossa""!).*  God has chosen a day when he will judge the earth in righteousness and those opposing him will be like excrement strewn upon the earth.  Many military men will be the food of birds.  There will be pillars of smoke and fire, with heat so hot that a person\'s flesh will melt from their body before they have a chance to fall to the ground(Bible book of Joel).  *There needs to be a UN fact finding mission to see why there was a massing of Catholic Poland\'s military and Italy\'s Air force on the Polish border before the Ukraine war started!  Now that is the site of the biggest military conglomeration in that area.  I feel that Rome(Italy) started the war from the border of Poland.  Poland had said that the military was there because Russia was sending migrants from the Middle East there.  Why would the Italian Airforce be there for migrants?  Migrants have a legal right under International law to immigrate from a war zone.  Poland and Italy are Catholic and Zellensky claims that Ukraine is becoming a Catholic State.  They have already banned the Orthodox Church there.  NATO\'s Ukraine proxy government has banned the Russian language(which many only speak), banned all opposition parties, so how can this be called a fight for Democracy? Two regions which refused to be part of the ""new Ukraine"" voted to separate in to their own Countries, but Ukraine/NATO would not recognize them.*  Britain installed two Prime Ministers which were not elected, and is instituting a 15 minute from home travel limit, with out a permit.  *Is that freedom?*  (king)Charles is an illegal heir.  *WW2 was to hide the German Nazi that married the British Queen, instead of her taking his name, he took hers.  Philip was a German, but renounced that to become a Greek citizen, and from there moved to Britain.  He became a Duke out of thin air and then a prince, and then married Queen Elizabeth.*  Catholicism and Protestantism are two legs of the Roman Beast.  *The Roman Empire made (false)Christianity the State religion after trying unsuccessfully to exterminate the true believers.  The Emperor brought in all the idols of false worship in to the church as Saints.  The Pope claims to be a celibate successor of the Bible\'s Apostle Peter, but according to the Bible, Peter had a mother in law, and if you have a mother in law, you have a wife.  Jesus healed Peter\'s wife\'s mother.  Paul said he chose to remain single, but could take a wife, just as Peter and the other Apostle\'s had done.* The whole system is a fraud, that kills to stay in power.  *Remember Britain and Australia lifting all corona restrictions, only to completely lock you down?  They made a (quasi)law no talking to strangers.  Think!*  The Vatican took trillions of dollars from Countries around the world to the Vatican Bank.  That loss of money will cause a deep recession/depression.  *That is why in Revelation/Apocalypse 18:6, it says, pay her back double for her crimes(read it!).*  America remember 1776!  *How are Protestant and Catholic Nations in a military alliance to wage war on all Countries against that alliance?*  Rome at war with all humanity?  *This is the very doctrine of the Roman General Marya.  When Rome says they need to get back to the Marian traditions, that means having a military continuously at war with your own people or other Nations, as prescribed by the Roman General Marya.*  If a child with in the Roman Empire expresses sentiments of wrongfulness about the System, then the child\'s mother will be told to give the child these poisonous berries or your whole family will be wiped out(British Royals grow a variety of poisonous plants).  They say the child has corona virus(corona-is Latin for crown-it means government, government-means govern your ment (govern your mind)).

The US has sanctions against many, if not all Communist States.  G7= (Revelation\'s 7heads) Christian Nations, and NATO is a Christian military alliance.*  Look at the Ukraine flag in Revelation!  *Some Bibles say hyacinth blue and sulfer yellow, and some say turquoise blue and sulfur yellow.*   Residential building bombing in Ukraine was not Russia, according to Alexy Arestovich Senior Ukrainian adviser.  Alexy quit and possibly the helicopter crash in Ukraine is to hide that?  *NATO using lies to attack Acts2:44,45(Russia and China...).*  CBDCs and Crypto are not the same.

Uvalde in Texas was at a school for instance, but please research the Texas church shooting. shooter walked in and more people than i can count unloaded on him before he could kill many people. maybe got 1 or 2 if that. shootings like this don’t happen in my state because anyone can carry concealed or unconcealed without a license as long as they meet age requirement. why would a shooter shoot here when they can go a state over where it’s almost impossible for someone to defend themselves or as i said they’ll choose a school because we make them vulnerable. and the cops at schools don’t count as protection, US supreme court has ruled Law Enforcement has no legal responsibility to protect a citizen from harm.

Considering he also had more key passes and chances created compared to mbappe.\n\nHow is it a fair criteria? Every player will have bad seasons. Including the best. That doesn’t make his good seasons any worse considering how many of them he had.\n\n“No players win games alone""\nHe had the best influence in the game. If mbappe won the WC and Messi didn’t score that last goal, everyone would’ve said he carried the final.\n\nWell that’s just wrong. He isn’t performing badly in 2022 season. In the 22/23 season, he hs a higher GA than games played (25 goals 18 assists in 31 games). That’s not terrible stats.\n\nWhat is that supposed to mean? How do you know he didn’t dropcform after moving to PSG? And where the hell do you get that definition? He is playing at an age a lot of players retire at and you expect him to play at his best ? He’s played 15+ good years. That’s an arbitrary criteria.\n\nRooney peaked early? Messi at 22 won a ballondor and proceeded to win 4 in a row. Even before that people were saying he was going to be the best ever\n\nChemistry comes from playing with the player and team not both of them being great. Great players can not fit into a squad or not get along with some players and so on. That’s how football works, not just two good players being shoved into a team. That’s why PSG has great players but isn’t a great team. Chemistry and team work doesn’t come from buying 100 m players.\n\nIt wasn’t a season and a half, it was one season. He regained form near the beginning of the season before the WC. He has more GA than games this season. That’s not “unproven"".\n\nYes but didn’t you call it a farmers league? Messi also spent his best years there but u complain it’s a farmers league. Messi is also proving it now in PSG.\n\nhttps://olympics.com/en/news/pele-goals-scored-football-career-how-many\n\nMessi doesn’t have half his skill! Is that why he replicated Maradonas best goal at 20? And scored many more similar goals in his entire career? And has way more goals and assists?\n\nMessi doesn’t NEED skills. If you consider skills on the ball to be actual football skills then you are mistaken. Messi can do body feigned and so on, making him the best dribbler in the world. Simple football is better and more efficient than flashy tricks. Cruyff said it too.\n\nAnd who has a better goal ratio? More assists? Better shot conversion? And so much more. Ronaldo isn’t even better at scoring when Messi can get 91 in a year and Ronaldo can’t get close (in your same so called farmers league and in a similarly good club) And did you just call the euro close to WC? Italy , the euro winners , couldn’t even qualify for the World Cup. And a weaker national team yet this year their national team was arguably better than Argentina. Messi has more trophies than Ronaldo as well. All you can do is name super specific stats . Messi has better dribbling shooting playmaking\n\nAre you stupid? Unbalancing players is literally what the tricks are for. Either you unbalance or use your speed. And again, simple football is better than tricky flashy skills. Messi has one of the best passing and finishing in the world. You just say Messi can’t do anything even though he can. Your comment shows you just hate Messi because you say he can’t do anything but unbalance players.', 1]","['@Dante he made more assists. Your point was it’s irrelevant because you can make a 2cm pass. I said he did not, he made good assists. \n\nThen how did Messi have more key passes and chances created?\n\nYes it’s not good but it’s not terrible. You just expect him to perform at his prime levels every season which is impossible for any player.\n\nMessi had to carry barca to the UCL knockouts those years\n\nAre you stupid? I meant beginning of this season, not last season.\n\nMan still dropped form. Yes he was better than Messi at PSG but as you said they were both “passed it"". Is Messi unable to have a bad season once in 15 or more years?\n\nYes they all had health issues. Players are still retiring at Messis age, look at Rooney, he was retired by Messis age and Messi was winning a WC.\n\nOr maybe it’s just your bad definition ?\n\nYou know you still need chemistry with the midfield and other attacker right? Neymar plays on the other wing. Again, you pull it out of your ass. Even you said his stats were “average"". He had one average season and you call him overrated.\n\nYou know Ronaldo also won almost all his ballondor s in the farmers league you’re talking about? And Pelé was actually playing in a farmers league and counting his friendly goals?! Maradona did not play with average teams. Messi is just a better Maradona. Ronaldo won more for his nation, while playing for a much much better nation than Argentina. How do you prove he had more skill? Messi is the best dribbler.\n\nC Ronaldo has fewer trophies than Messi. Messi is way more skilled. Messi is better in almost everything compared to him.\n\nZidane had way more skills? Messis dribbler is the best; and he’s top in almost everything. Every player you listed is good at one thing or another but lacks in some areas.

If the team he plays for is so much better generally speaking than all but one other team that they dominate the league it doesn't matter how good the other teams are because the natural result of playing for a dominant team is that his stats go up more than they would elsewhere, he's playing with better players in his own squad, better in fact than most other great teams in Europe because of the factors I've previously stated.\n\nGoing back a hundred years is completely relevant because it shows exactly how dominant they've been both in domestic and European games. They've had more xed results over the years against English teams, they edge it of course but that should be expected given those same factors i mentioned previously. Even in the last 20 yes English sides have managed to beat them both at times so that shows they have been better than them until they farmed them for their best players. \n\nSo because Athletic Bilbao best Manutd once when Man it's were a decent side that means la Liga is better than PL in your logic? So what happened in 2006/7 when Liverpool best Barca? They finished 21 points behind leaders in EPL Does that mean PL was better than La Liga then using same logic?\n\nI'm no Brit but I do think the average PL team is better than the average La Liga team, this is played out by the fact that even when English clubs win in Europe and best Spanish clubs, they still don't dominate their own league like the two Spanish clubs do and the fact there's  more widespread winners in the EPL.\n\nMan city have dominated recently sure, because they've got way more money and have a top manager. Klopp and Liverpool have rivalled them in the last few years with just Klopps ability to get good players cheap and make them play well  and It's rivalled them for a period before that as well as a win for Chelsea in between as well but yes in the last few years having a nation state owned club does turn things a bit although not to the same degree as in Spain, Newcastle can be expected up there soon as well.\n\nThe PL has not been decided by February in the last few years, there was one point in it in two of the last 4 and 2 different clubs won it in the other two.

Even if you count the so called ""official matches"" he\'s way ahead on goals per game and he played in an era with terrible fouls and protection and health care.\n\nLet that sink in, his best year was 1959 with 126Mbappe was way more influential than Messi both in final and tournament, easily the best player.\n\nMessi has 14 assists and 13 goals in 22/23 season, that\'s not goat levels.\n\nHis stats show his form dropped after the move to PSG, that\'s how I know, I don\'t expect his best age but I do expect better than he has done for the few years he\'s been at PSG if he is the goat.\n\nAs I said some players have different career lengths, Rooney was playing as good as anyone at 18, not 22 like Messi, but the age they started isn\'t relevant, it\'s just genetics and some players can play longer than others.\n\nBoth Messi and Neymar proved they could play together at Barca so that boots your chemistry theory out the door, the team dominates the league, the team is doing well, there\'s no issues with chemistry.\n\nMessi didn\'t replicate Maradona goal, it was completely different, Maradona did it through tricks and skill, Messi just uses his size to unbalance players, there\'s nothing more to his game, show me Messi performing the same touches, volley, dribbles and tricks as Maradona, watch Maradona videos to see his abilities, Messi was never like that, his entire game is built on using his size to unbalance players he runs at, nothing more. He has more goals and assist because he played in a team that was built to use him that way, Maradona had to play further back in lesser teams where he had to do more in the build up play and got fouled way more back then and played less games. No comparison at all, Maradona was way more skilled, even Ronaldinho was way more skilled in that type of thing. \n\nTrick and touches and volleys and all the other skills in football contribute to how great a player is, simple football is all the things that are possible to do, if it creates openings, if you put Messi in the teams of the other he wouldn\'t be successful the same way as his game is built on himself and it takes a great team built around him to be successful, he doesn\'t have the other skills required to make the chances possible. Cruyff was the same type of player as the likes of Zidane etc, it was all touches and tricks and great passing.\n\nIt makes sense Messi has better assists as hes played in a dominant possession team which creates more chances for higher assist stats whilst Ronaldo had to do it more on his own in a new league in a team not built around him and still got more goals in all comps, one year doesn\'t mean a thing to overall greatness, Ronaldo got the most goals.\n\nYes I did call EC close to WC, it is, except for Brazil and Argentina the standard team is as good as WC and the worst teams are better than the WC worst teams. Italy not getting to one WC somehow means the competition through history isn\'t as good🤦 they won the most world cups after Brazil but because they don\'t get there one year that means the WC isn\'t so good in your logic🙈.\n\nYou said earlier that teams aren\'t great based on players but now you say Italy better than Argentina, sorry that\'s not true, Argentina are clearly better as the won the world cup, facts are facts.\n\nMessi played in one team, that was built for him since childhood in the same league, obviously Ronaldo moving around so much in teams not built for him since childhood won\'t result in the same chance for success, regardless he was still very successful everywhere he went and won all the competitions,  Ronaldo has better dribbling, shooting, heading, skills, Messi is only better at running and using his size to unbalance players.\n\nSimple football if successful is good but skillful awe inspiring football when successful is much better, Messi was a one trick pony, boring. Messi finishing is actually not great, if you look at the times he shoots from narrow angles he misses at a higher rate than other top finishers, his goals come from dribbling round the keeper or tap ins from team goals etc, look at his penalty record, his finishing is not great, Ronaldo is better finisher. Messi is also not a great passer, he is adequate but no Pirlo or Scholars or Gerrard.\n\nI\'m saying he\'s overrated by his fanboys like you, not that he can\'t do anything, I\'m saying he can\'t do the other things as good as other players, his skill is based on his size and running at players and unbalancing them he doesn\'t Excell in anything else.

If another player gets overall one less assist but his assists are on average better that is more of a credit to him than the guy who got more assists total but to a lesser standard. This is obvious.\n\nI expect a player who you claim is the best ever to perform to a higher standard than that every season and at different clubs. That's a fair criteria for the so called best player ever.\n\nMessi didn't carry anything, no player wins games alone, the team around him were of a very hight standard just because he's the one the teams built around from childhood which helps him standout doesn't mean he carried them.\n\ni meant this season as well, his stats for the whole year of 22 were terrible so the second half of it were also terrible by default.\n\nHe didn't drop form, his team weren't as dominant as they had been and Messi joined a dominant team.

There's really no excuse. \n\nHe's overrated because you are claiming he's the best ever, that title comes to those who don't have an average full season and a half and are completely unproven in a team outside the one built for him since childhood. \n\nIt makes sense Ronaldo won most his Balondors in Spain as that was where he spent his best years, he also won in other nations and proved he could do it when the team wasn't built for him and the league wasn't the one he'd been in all his life in more competitive leagues.\n\nEven if Pele counted his friendly goals(prove that claim), he still scored way more real goals than Messi and he didn't play in a farmers league it was competitive like it is to this day but if you are going to say that about Pele you have to hold Messi to the same standard. He also proved himself at world cups and is without piers in that department.\n\nMaradona did play with average teams, Napoli was bottom half team when he went and became the difference to win the title against some of the best sides in history in seria A at that time. He also took an average Argentina to world cup win  with his match winning influence on the team much greater than any other in history. His skills were without pier, he was the most skillful attacking player ever, and could do literally anything with a football. Messi doesn't have half his skill.\n\nRonaldo played in some good sides but not better defensively both styles can win titles, Ronaldo was the greatest and the one who won those titles for his nation, but for injuries he would've won much more. If you want proof he had more skill watch his dribbles and tricks, he was like Ronaldinho and with speed and finishing lethal, Messi just uses his small size to unbalance players, no skill or tricks with the ball.\n\nC. Ronaldo has scored more league, Champions League and national team goals than Messi, has won more CLs and with a Wesker national team has won a tournament which is close to WC in level, more European player of the year awards and all whilst playing in several😆 different leagues, in no way can you say that Messi is better at everything, that's absurd.\n\nZidane has way more skills, the only thing Messi is better at is using his size to unbalance players, he has no ability of a great other than that, Zidane could do anything with a football like Maradona style but not quite as good as him, dribbling tricks, volley, headers, touches and finishing, Messi can't do those things like players such as Zidane, Maradona, Ronaldinho, Baggio, Zola etc.\n\nGeorge Best had alcohol addiction, it's a medical psychological condition, regardless he was up there with Maradona as the most gifted player that ever lived, he could beat a player, then continue to beat that player again and again just because he could and then beat everyone else and score, only Maradona I have seen do such things other than him, he was dominant in the league and in Europe and would've been internationally but for playing for a weak team, if his career had gone on longer he would've still been up there but his ability was right up there with anyone."", 0]","[""@oeoeoeoeoeoeoeoe Your claim wasn't that he made two good assists, your claim was he was the highest assister in the comp, so either he makes the most good assists or the stay isn't relevant.\n\nMbappe s ored and created goals with pure skill, much better skill than Messi, not only did he score more goals but his goals were much better, not tap ins and made by himself.\n\nMessi got 14 assists and 11 goals in a whole year, that's not only not great, it's not even good and you are trying to argue it's evidence of being talked about as the best ever.\n\nBalon for is a corrupt organisation that awards people because of their reputation rather than actual performance, there were at least 2 times in the Ronaldo Messi era that out performed them yet it was awarded to them anyway. That aside, Barca never underperformed compared to most teams in Europe when he played for them, the players he played with were all internationals and they always competed for trophies, it's not surprising he would still be up for the awards when other players don't have teams designed from childhood around them.\n\nHe didn't gain any form at the start of the season, you just pulled that out your behind, his stats for the whole year are 14a and 11g which is bang average.\n\nRonaldo was bang at it at Juve even though he was passed it at that point, and Juve weren't completely dominant anymore at that point as other teams had improved.

Eventually that culminated in 99 and from that point we\'ve had very good success in Europe by multiple teams, if it weren\'t for the two Spanish teams poaching their best players  at crucial times the gap would be much closer and Real and Barca wouldn\'t have won so much in the last 10-15 years.\n\nI never suggested that a farmers league is called such because they farm other teams,  you even quoted the definition I gave for one in the previous paragraph to that so I\'m not sure how you came to that conclusion.\n\nWhen a club or 2 in a league completely dominate a league both in results and points nearly always it\'s a farmers league for them.\n\n In your definition with the local Sunday league, if one team dominates that league it\'s a farmers league for them regardless of the overall quality, if it\'s competitive it\'s not a farmers league. The component that makes it a farmers league is having a team that dominates against teams that aren\'t ""real teams"".\n\nThe prem overall from top to bottom being superior is significant, because it shows in the way that the teams are far more competitive and always have been throughout history, it\'s never been a farmers league generally speaking, even when great sides have arisen such as Liverpool in the 70\'s and 80\'s and Man it\'s in the 90\'s and 00\'s there wasn\'t a gulf between them and their rivals and overall the European performance has been close to all their European counterparts.

Liverpool and Chelsea in particular had great success against them, Liverpool lost their best players just at the time Real bought Ronaldo and the others and so they got some success against them in that weak period, they wouldn't have done just a year earlier. \n\nThings are always much more complex than the results like you gave show.\nJust before Ronaldo went to Real, England had a period of dominance in Europe, Liverpool dominated Real in the champions league in one of those which led to them buying Ronaldo and unsettling Utds team and success by releasing to the press their interest which they have always done, buying up the majority of the world's best players, Barcelona have done the same in the last 3 decades.

Bout to get nerdy so bear with me.\n\nIf I wanted to look at how dominant a team is in a league, I can't just look at their raw points or goal difference because it doesn't take into account how relatively good it is. Instead, I need to find the league's goal difference's standard deviation. Then, I need to find how many standard deviation's a team's goal difference is from the mean, which will be 0. There's a decent amount of math that goes into it, which I wont explain unless asked.\n\nUsing Standard deviation is important because it takes into account how variable  and relatively good the goal differences are. For example: If Bayern Munich has a goal difference of 20 for a season, it might seem like they had a bad year. But, if the standard deviation for goal difference in the Bundesliga was 5, then Bayern's goal difference would be four standard deviations above league average, which is an extraordinary performance. \n\nIf a league's standard deviation for goal difference is lower, it means teams tend to be closer to one another in their abilities because their goal differences tend to be closer to zero on average. The more similar everyone's goal difference is, the more competitive the league tends to be. So, A lower standard deviations for the league tends to mean it is more competitive.\n\nTaking all this into account, what I did was determine both the epl and la liga's standard deviations for goal difference. I then used that to determine how many standard deviations from the mean top teams in each league were. I did this for the past 11 seasons. Then I took the average of each team and league over this 11 season timeframe. Here are the results:\n\nPrem: 27.45\nLa Liga: 27.63\n\nBarca: 2.37\nMadrid: 2.04\nAtletico: 1.25\n\nMan City: 2.03\nLiverpool: 1.32\nChelsea: 1.11\nMan U: 1.07\nTottenham: 0.92\nArsenal: 0.87\n\nWhat this means is that statistically, the Prem and La Liga are just as competitive. The variance of the goals scored across both leagues are practically the same. If the Prem were more competitive, we would expect to see it's goal difference to have a much lower standard deviation than La Liga's because in more competitive league we expect teams to have a closer goal difference. \n\nAnother thing to note is that Real Madrid and Man City have basically the same average standard deviation. This means that Man City has been just as dominant in the EPL over the last 11 seasons as Madrid has been in La Liga. To suggest the overall level of play in the EPL has been significantly higher than La Liga would also be saying that Man City has been a significantly better team than Real Madrid, which we both know isn't true. If La Liga is truly a farmer's league, wouldn't we expect Real Madrid to dominate at a much higher level than Man City dominates the Prem?\n\nYes, La Liga is more skewed towards the very top, but both league are still equally competitive. Having an opinion is one things, but an objective statistical truth is another. If you want me to share my work send me your email."", 0]","['@Dante Actually, I got a question. If you removed Real Madrid and Barca from la liga, would that make it more or less of a farmers league in your opinion?', 0]","[""@Dante Alright. This is pointless. I'm not going to be able to change your mind and you won't be able to change mine. \n\nBy your definition, it's a farmers league. We basically already know Barca, Real Madrid, or Atletico is winning it before the season starts.\n\nBy the actual definition of a farmers league, it's not a farmers league. It's the second best league in the world. The average level of play, while slightly lower than the EPL's is still the second highest in the world. The reason why everyone is upset with you calling La Liga a farmers league is that it implies there is a poor level of play overall which takes away from the accomplishments of not only Madrid and Barca but also Messi, Ronaldo, and all the other La Liga legends."", 0]","['@Dante Me: ""If you put prime Real Madrid and Barca in the EPL, they would make it a farmers league too""\nYou: ""No they wouldn\'t because the league is far superior overall""\nMe: Shows combined 27-12-8 record of barca and real vs top 6 epl teams (aka prime real madrid and barca dominating top English teams)\nYou: ""I\'m not sure why you are responding to me with the stats that Barca and Real had against English sides in a small window of time when Messi and Ronaldo played for them""\n\nPrime Barca and Madrid dominated over the top English sides. Just because you lose and draw some games doesn\'t mean you\'re not dominant. In La Liga last season, madrid was 26-8-4 and Barca was 21-10-7. They dominated la liga, yet are comparable to the combined records prime Real and Barca had against English sides (27-12-8). \n\nIf we are going to talk about long term history though, Manchester United from 1992-93 to 2012-13 won the EPL 13 out of the 20 seasons, yet only managed to win the champions league twice, which would suggest the the EPL is a farmers league by your logic: ""A farmers league is a league where a team or 2 completely dominates nearly all the time over history with a massive gap in points. The results in Europe show they are not too different from other European super clubs overall, even if better overall, and their European counterparts leagues are far more competitive""\n\nIt\'s not called a ""Farmer\'s league"" because the top teams farm other teams. It\'s meant as a dig at the level of play, suggesting that they players are farmers as their day jobs. For example, calling the Bundesliga a ""Farmer\'s league"" is meant as a dig at Bayern suggesting that they aren\'t playing against real teams. Your local Sunday League could be competitive where everyone is evenly matched, but it\'s still a farmer\'s league.\n\nThe the Prem from top to bottom is a better league than La Liga, but it\'s not as significant as you make it out to be. Spain is still the second or third best league in the world. If you were to combine La Liga and the EPL, I doubt you would see significant trend of Spanish teams doing far worse. In other words, Bad la liga teams and Bad EPL teams are probably similar in their level of play, same with average teams. It\'s just that England has more Elite teams while La Liga really only has two, maybe three if you count Atletico.', 0]","['@Dante Messi at Barca vs top 6 English clubs (W-D-L):\nMan U: 4-1-1\nMan City: 5-0-1\nLiverpool: 2-0-2\nChelsea: 2-6-2\nArsenal: 4-1-1\nTottenham: 1-1-0\nOverall Record: 18-9-7\n\nRonaldo at Madrid vs top 6 English Clubs:\nMan U: 2-1-0\r\nMan City: 2-1-0\r\nLiverpool: 3-0-0\r\nChelsea: 0-0-0\r\nArsenal: 0-0-0\r\nTottenham: 2-1-1\r\nOverall Record: 9-3-1\n\nCombined overall records: 27-12-8\nAgainst the best teams in the EPL, Prime Barca and Madrid dominate.

I must admit I can think of many situations where it appears that it would be worth it, but in the long run, there's still violence in the hearts of many people and it's being taught to many children as a way to solve problems.\n\nLook at the formation of Israel, the Jewish people needed a country to call their own because of the unspeakable violence done to them, they gained some land of their own, and used violence to clear that land of the non Jewish people that lived there.

Not totally, not every mentally ill patient blames childhood, but it is absolutely 10000% true for many. And remember many of these patients are in their 40s….. in the 70s and 80s mental health was still so misunderstood, stigmatised and seen as something ‘dangerous’ or ‘evil’ that many of these patients didn’t get the medical help they needed until things were so bad that they were thrown in prison. They’re not all cut and dry criminals. Look at ‘Adam’, look how scarred and deformed his hands and arms are because of the harm he caused himself…. Self harm isn’t just a cry for help, it’s often a person choosing to hurt themselves instead of someone else because deep down they somehow managed to learn from somewhere that hurting others is wrong. \n\nWe are all born as pure beings, we don’t know what to think or feel or how to behave. We are taught that, by our parents, families and by society. Just like you were. If you are told you are something enough times, it is easy to become it and believe that’s what you’re supposed to be. And these ideas and feelings are often imprinted between the ages of 8-12 years. Just remember that.', 0]","['The heartbreaking thing is that you’re so right. I used to work in a low security locked facility and the common denominator was usually the feeling, sense or physical experience of being unwanted and unloved as a child. Parents have a lot to answer for when they screw up their kids then dump them in care or on relatives because they’re ‘evil, the devil, weird, not a normal little boy or girl’ etc because the kid acts out and does something perceived as screwed up or does commit a crime when all it was, was a cry for some attention and to be noticed.\n\nObviously it’s not everyone who ends up on these wards; I’ve met many with very loving and very desperate families too; but abandonment or feeling hated and unwanted as a child is definitely up there as a top, common feeling among patients with illnesses such as schizophrenia, psychosis, BPD, PD etc.\n\nWith my whole heart I hope that ‘Adam’ and ‘Dylan’ were successful integrating into their MSU’s. What a lot of people don’t realise is that these patients also very easily develop attachment anxiety and a sort of Stockholm syndrome to the routine, staff, walls and order that they feel was the first time somebody gave a genuine crap about them. The number of ‘reoffenders’ who have say one bad day, panic and do something that they know will get them transferred back to their previous ‘safety net’ is heartbreaking. A lot of the time it’s not that they want to hurt staff or another patient, it’s just the surest and quickest way they know that will get them sent back to familiarity. Some patients also routinely jeopardise their own progress for fear of leaving these units because they are fully aware of the stigmas that still fly around in society, which is so sad. And hard to break through.\n\nImagine being told your entire childhood that you’re not wanted and often neglected as such, developing a mental disorder because the brain tried to find a way to cope with that physical and mental trauma, then working through a gruelling recovery programme that; as this documentary shows can take 15+ years, to finally reach opportunity to integrate into society, only for society to brand you as a ‘weirdo’, ‘dangerous’, ‘should be locked up’, ‘shouldn’t be living here’ etc….. And society wonders why some of these people become the things that they brand them. All their life they have been told by other people what they are. Society has as much to answer for as some parents in this scenario.\n\nIt takes 2 seconds for someone to make judgement and run their mouth. Then go about their life and forget that comment after a few minutes or whatever. Someone on a recovery path could hear that and be affected for LIFE because of someone who doesn’t know them. Please, please, please people - always think about your words and never dismiss someone who’s been in a facility. There are often kind, funny, capable, passionate, empathetic people behind even the worst disorders and symptoms.\n\nJust make some effort to get to know the person, not the illness. That gesture alone could be the positive intervention someone needs to drive their goal of reintegration.\n\nWe are all born pure beings - we don’t know what to think or feel. We are taught it. Every single one of us is taught it one way or another.
